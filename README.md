# Simulation-Project: Renewable Energy System Simulation

This project focuses on simulating a renewable energy system for the **Service Center for Computer Systems and Communication (SCC)** at Bauhaus University, Weimar. The system integrates photovoltaic (solar) panels and wind turbines to meet the energy demands of SCC servers while reducing carbon emissions.

## Overview

- **Objective**: To simulate and optimize renewable energy sources for high-demand servers.
- **Tools Used**: [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/) (Agent-Based, Discrete Event, and System Dynamics Modeling).
- **Scope**:
  - Energy generation via solar and wind sources.
  - Energy storage with batteries.
  - Reduction in grid dependency.
  - Feasibility analysis of renewable energy adoption.
